Hypothesis 2: Wealth

Method A (Pclass) Survival Rates:
Pclass
1    68.91%
2    48.00%
3    23.91%

Method B (FareBin) Survival Rates:
FareBin
Low         22.94%
Medium      44.17%
High        33.64%
VeryHigh    60.94%

Conclusion Comparison of Methods A and B:
The data clearly shows a correlation between wealth and survival
. Passengers in the highest wealth bracket (1st Class and Very High Fare) had advantage: 
 1st Class passengers survived at a rate of 69.00%, and those paying the highest fares survived at 61.00%.
While, passengers in the lowest wealth bracket (3rd Class and Low Fare) were the least likely to survive: 
 3rd Class passengers had a survival rate of only 24.00%, while those in the lowest fare quantile survived at 23.00%.
Because both Method A (discrete class) and Method B (continuous fare) show similar trends higher wealth equals higher survival the hypothesis that socio-economic status determined access to lifeboats is strongly supported.
